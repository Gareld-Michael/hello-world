# hello-world
This is my repository for resources and hopfully a place to start to learn more about code.
Personnally I find coding to be, even after just starting, a very fun and challenging thing. Thats why I need help...,so please feel EXTREMELY free to try to correct me at anything you find that is wrong, ineffecient, or that you are having an anoyance spasm over (whatever the acronym is) (sorry for spelling).
